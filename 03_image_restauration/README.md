We have prepared a google doc that will help you run through these exercises. 
You can access it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yTNrIxFCOnm2QgyjO_5Dk0dXud7RBPxeGkMkeYX_sb4/edit?usp=sharing), 
and even comment on it... so... if you want us to know how to improve the exercises or so... let us know!
